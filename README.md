# Fibonacci-Sequence-and-others_with-File-I-O

This program can output .txt files with the following mathematical sequences:
1. Fibonacci Sequence
2. Pascual's Triangle
3. Floyd's Triangle
This creates a temporary.txt file in which you can add the mathematical sequences then after adding the mathematical sequences to the file, you can rename the file in whatever name you like it to be. This program also deletes all unnamed files.

Features:
1. Choose between the Fibonacci Sequence, Pascual's Triangle, and Floyd's Triangle.
2. Can output the Fibonacci Sequence in the .txt file.
3. Can output the Pascual's Triangle in the .txt file.
4. Can output the Floyd's Triangle in the .txt file.
5. The file can be named after creation.
6. The contents in the file can be read from the program. This is done by typing the name of the file and for it to be read.
